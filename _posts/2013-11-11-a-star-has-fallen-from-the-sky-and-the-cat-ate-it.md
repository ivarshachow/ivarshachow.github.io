Many creators ask for engagement but do not give it.

Instagram is not a broadcast platform. It is a social one.

> You receive what you practice.

## What actually boosts engagement

Engagement improves when you:
- Reply to comments early
- Engage with similar creators
- Stay active around posting time

These are habits, not hacks.

## The first hour rule

The first hour after posting matters.  
That is when Instagram tests your content.

I stay active during that time. I reply fast. I interact genuinely.

## Why engagement feels slow initially

Trust takes time. People watch silently before interacting.

Consistency breaks that silence.

## Remember

Engagement grows when you show up as a participant, not just a creator.
