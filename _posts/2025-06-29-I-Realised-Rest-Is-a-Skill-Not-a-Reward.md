I used to treat rest as something I earned. If I worked hard enough, I allowed myself to rest. If I didn’t, I felt guilty doing nothing.

That mindset slowly burned me out.

## Why I avoided rest

Rest felt unproductive. Silence made me uncomfortable. Slowing down felt like falling behind.

So I kept pushing. Even when tired. Even when focus dropped. Even when enjoyment disappeared.

I told myself it was discipline. It wasn’t. It was neglect.

## What burnout taught me

Burnout forced me to stop. Not gently. Completely.

During that phase, I realised rest is not optional. It is foundational.

Without rest:
- Focus declines
- Decisions worsen
- Discipline weakens
- Motivation disappears

Rest supports growth. It does not interrupt it.

## Learning to rest intentionally

I stopped waiting for exhaustion to rest. I started scheduling it.

Simple pauses. Quiet time. Days without pressure.

Rest restored energy and clarity. Productivity improved naturally.

## Final reflection

Rest is not laziness.  
It is maintenance.

Growth lasts longer when rest is respected.
