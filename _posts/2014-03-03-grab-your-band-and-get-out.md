Most creators think monetisation starts when brands approach them. That belief delays growth and creates frustration.

Monetisation actually starts earlier — when people **trust your recommendations**.

> If people don’t trust you for free advice, they won’t trust paid suggestions.

## Why creators lose trust while monetising

Common mistakes:
- Promoting random products
- Accepting every brand deal
- Talking more about money than value
- Hiding paid promotions

Audiences sense misalignment quickly.

## My approach to monetisation

I followed one rule strictly:
I promoted only what I would use myself.

That meant saying no often.  
That felt uncomfortable initially.  
But it built long-term credibility.

## Ways to monetise ethically

You don’t need millions of followers.

You can monetise through:
- One-on-one consultations
- Digital guides
- Affiliate products you trust
- Brand collaborations aligned with your niche

Small audiences with high trust convert better than large silent audiences.

## Timing matters

Do not rush monetisation.  
Let your audience ask first.

When people start messaging:
“How can I learn more?”
“Do you offer guidance?”

That is your signal.

## Final advice

Protect trust like currency.  
Money follows integrity.
