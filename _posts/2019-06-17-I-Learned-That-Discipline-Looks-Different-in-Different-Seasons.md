Earlier, I believed discipline had one definition. Wake up early. Work long hours. Push consistently.

Life corrected that belief.

## When old discipline stopped working

There were phases when energy dropped. Responsibilities increased. Mental bandwidth reduced.

The discipline that once worked started feeling heavy.

I blamed myself instead of adjusting expectations.

## Redefining discipline

I learned that discipline is not fixed behaviour. It is commitment to effort within current limits.

Some seasons allow intensity. Others require restraint.

Both are valid.

## Consistency through flexibility

When I adapted discipline to life instead of forcing life to adapt to discipline, consistency improved.

Growth became realistic, not exhausting.

## Final reflection

Discipline that adapts survives.  
Discipline that rigidly insists breaks.
