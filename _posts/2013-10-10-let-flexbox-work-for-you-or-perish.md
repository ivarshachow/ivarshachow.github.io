Posts bring people in.  
Stories make them stay.

I noticed this clearly when people replied to my stories more than my posts. Stories feel personal. They feel human.

> Trust grows in private moments, not public performance.

## Why stories matter so much

Stories show:
- Your thinking
- Your process
- Your honesty

They remove the pressure of perfection.

People follow influencers they feel connected to, not impressed by.

## How I use stories intentionally

I stopped posting random stories. I started sharing:
- Daily thoughts
- Behind-the-scenes
- Simple opinions
- Polls and questions

That increased replies, which increased visibility.

## Engagement loop

When people reply to your stories, Instagram shows them more of your content.

That loop builds loyalty silently.

## Key insight

If posts are your shop window, stories are your conversation.
