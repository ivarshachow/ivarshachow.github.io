Instagram pushes the idea of daily posting. Many creators burn out trying to follow it blindly.

Consistency does not mean frequency.  
Consistency means **predictability**.

> Your audience should know what to expect from you.

## What consistency actually means

Consistency has three parts:
1. Topic consistency  
2. Tone consistency  
3. Posting rhythm consistency  

You can post three times a week and still grow. You can post daily and still fail.

The difference is intention.

## How I built a sustainable system

I stopped planning daily. I planned weekly.

Every Sunday, I decided:
- What problem I’ll address this week
- What formats I’ll use
- When I’ll post

That removed daily decision fatigue.

## Why breaks don’t kill growth

Many creators fear breaks.  
Breaks do not kill growth. Inconsistency does.

If you disappear randomly, people forget.  
If you pause intentionally and return clearly, growth continues.

Instagram values return behaviour more than nonstop posting.

## Key takeaway

Build a pace you can maintain for one year.  
That is real consistency.
