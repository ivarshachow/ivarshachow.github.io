I avoided collaborations initially because I felt “too small”. That was a mistake.

Collaborations work best when both creators grow together.

## What makes a good collaboration

Good collaborations have:
- Similar audience size
- Similar niche
- Mutual respect

Big accounts rarely convert well for small creators.

## How I approach collaborations

I keep it simple and honest.  
No fancy pitches. No pressure.

That builds long-term relationships.

## Final thought

Collaborate for relevance, not reach.
