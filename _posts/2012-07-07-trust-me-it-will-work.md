Most captions fail because they try too hard to sound smart.

People do not open captions for vocabulary. They open captions for **connection**.

I realised this after rewriting one caption in plain language. That post received more comments than my previous ten combined.

> Simple language travels further.

## What makes people read captions

People read captions when:
- The first line feels personal
- The story flows naturally
- The message feels honest

Writing like a human beats writing like a marketer.

## My caption structure

I follow a simple flow:
- Relatable opening
- Personal insight
- Practical takeaway
- Clear question

This structure keeps people engaged without forcing it.

## Why comments matter

Comments signal depth.  
Likes signal approval.  
Saves signal value.

Good captions increase all three.

## Remember

Write like you are speaking to one person, not performing for many.
