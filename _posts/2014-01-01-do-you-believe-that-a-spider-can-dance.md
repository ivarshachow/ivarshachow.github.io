I once checked insights daily. That drained motivation.

Now, I check weekly.

## Metrics that actually matter

I focus on:
- Saves
- Shares
- Profile visits

Likes fluctuate. Value remains.

## Using data correctly

I look for patterns, not perfection.

One bad post does not mean failure.

## Reminder

Use insights to learn, not judge yourself.
